# OpenLane / Skywater130 project. 

RISC-V based MiniSoC supporting Wave-Pipelined Dynamic-Interleaved-Multi-Threading 

It is important to notice, that each wave is an individual thread, so there is no (register-file) dependency between the waves.

System-Hyper-Pipelined MiniSoC

232 MHz running 3 waves 

8 independent threads

RV32iMC-P3C4D8W3

Timer with 128 programmable events

32 GPIOs with programmable trigger-units for SW-defined protocols

SkyWater 0,18Âµm, Efabless Shuttle 8
